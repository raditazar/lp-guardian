# LP Guardian

LP Guardian is an AI-assisted liquidity-position risk system for concentrated LPs. It scans wallet-owned LP positions, verifies ownership, computes portfolio risk, streams a diagnosis through an agent pipeline, and anchors verifiable report provenance on Robinhood Chain testnet.

The project was built as an end-to-end hackathon stack: React web app, Hono backend, MCP server, ElizaOS-compatible agent runtime, and Arbitrum Stylus contracts.

## Live Demo

- Web app: https://lp-guardian-web.vercel.app
- Backend: https://lp-guardianserver-production.up.railway.app
- Health check: https://lp-guardianserver-production.up.railway.app/health

## What It Does

- Wallet-first LP discovery on Robinhood Chain testnet through NFPM transfer scanning.
- Ownership validation with `ownerOf(tokenId)` before diagnosis proceeds.
- Portfolio-level risk input aggregation from real wallet positions when available.
- Agent diagnosis pipeline with correlation IDs, state tracking, retries, provenance labels, and SSE streaming.
- Autonomous monitor service for watched wallets.
- MCP tools so other AI agents can call LP Guardian through a standard interface.
- Stylus/Rust contracts for report anchoring, portfolio risk scoring, and swap replay provenance.
- React dashboard for wallet lookup, portfolio positions, diagnosis phases, agent state, reports, and migration/rebalance previews.

## Architecture

```text
apps/web      React + Vite dashboard
apps/server   Hono API, portfolio services, agent orchestration, monitor, SSE
apps/mcp-server
              STDIO MCP adapter over the backend portfolio tools
packages/core Shared TypeScript types and honesty/provenance helpers
contracts     Arbitrum Stylus Rust contracts deployed on Robinhood Chain testnet
tee-attestor  Local attestation service scaffold for TEE-verdict experiments
```

High-level flow:

```text
Wallet address
  -> Robinhood NFPM scan
  -> ownerOf validation
  -> position and pool-state reads
  -> aggregate risk input
  -> 6-agent portfolio pipeline
  -> report JSON + provenance
  -> optional Robinhood Chain anchor
  -> web UI / MCP consumers
```

## Sponsor And Partner Technology

## Deployed Robinhood Chain Contracts

Network: Robinhood Chain testnet (`chainId=46630`)

Deployment metadata lives in `contracts/deployments/robinhood-testnet.json`.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+
- Rust toolchain only if you are building the Stylus contracts

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Copy environment defaults:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the backend:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

Run the web app in another terminal:

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

Open the local web app from the Vite output, usually `http://localhost:5173`.

## Important Environment Variables

For local development, start from `.env.example`.

```env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173,https://lp-guardian-web.vercel.app

ROBINHOOD_RPC=https://robinhood-testnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_API_KEY>
ROBINHOOD_CHAIN_ID=46630
ROBINHOOD_NFPM_ADDRESS=0x...
ROBINHOOD_V3_FACTORY_ADDRESS=0x...
ROBINHOOD_SCAN_FROM_BLOCK=0

LPGUARDIAN_REPORTS_CONTRACT=0x9803be5349eedf7c28ac1914b743757ce043b7cc
LPGUARDIAN_RISK_ENGINE_CONTRACT=0x8d21329ac9d7785333cb41e187e556a8f7b81ec0
LPGUARDIAN_SWAP_REPLAY_CONTRACT=0x75191d7ca10ea9c36b88b169896d4f258702afa2

AGENT_RUNTIME=mock
STRATEGIST_PROVIDER=mock
GEMINI_API_KEY=
```

Production frontend env should point at the backend base URL without `/api`:

```env
VITE_LPGUARDIAN_API_URL=https://lp-guardianserver-production.up.railway.app
```

## Main API Surface

```http
GET /health
GET /api/positions/:walletAddress
GET /api/portfolio/:walletAddress/positions
GET /api/diagnose/:tokenId?walletAddress=0x...
POST /api/portfolio/diagnose

GET /agent/runtime
GET /agent/monitor/:walletAddress/stream
POST /agent/monitor/:walletAddress/watch
POST /agent/orchestration/run
GET /agent/orchestration/stream/:correlationId
```

The backend marks degraded or synthetic paths with provenance labels such as `VERIFIED`, `UNAVAILABLE`, or `EMULATED` so the UI and MCP consumers can avoid treating fallback data as real chain evidence.

## MCP Server

The MCP server is a STDIO adapter over the same backend services used by the web app.

Start the backend first:

```bash
pnpm dev:server
```

Run MCP:

```bash
LPGUARDIAN_API_URL=http://localhost:3001 pnpm dev:mcp
```

Registered tools:

- `lp_guardian_ping`
- `portfolio_diagnose`
- `portfolio_simulate`
- `portfolio_optimize`
- `portfolio_execute`
- `portfolio_monitor`

## Useful Scripts

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm build:server
pnpm typecheck:server
pnpm typecheck:mcp

pnpm --filter @lp-guardian/server agent:test
pnpm --filter @lp-guardian/server agent:reliability
pnpm --filter @lp-guardian/server canonical:smoke
pnpm --filter @lp-guardian/server smoke:robinhood-contracts
pnpm --filter @lp-guardian/server smoke:swap-replay
```

## Contract Development

Install Stylus tooling:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --force cargo-stylus
```

Run tests from each contract package:

```bash
cd contracts/portfolio-report-registry
cargo test

cd ../portfolio-risk-engine
cargo test

cd ../swap-replay-verifier
cargo test
```

See `contracts/README.md` and `contracts/CONTRACTS.md` for ABI exports, deployment commands, and `cast` smoke checks.

## Repository Notes For Judges

- Core application code lives in `apps/server`, `apps/web`, `apps/mcp-server`, `packages/core`, and `contracts`.
- The backend is intentionally wallet-first: token IDs are still supported for compatibility, but ownership is checked before token-specific diagnosis.
- Mock and fallback paths are kept for demo resilience, but they are labeled in API output and UI state.
- The Robinhood Chain testnet has no public explorer in this project, so contract addresses and deployment transaction hashes are recorded in the repo.
